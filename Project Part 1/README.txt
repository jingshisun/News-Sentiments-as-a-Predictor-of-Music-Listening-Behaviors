1) "project_1.py"       
 
                    Contains the Python code that performs the following functions:

                    gettracks(): Collects a set number of songs from the list of most 
                                 popular songs from the previous 7 days using the Last.fm 
                                 API. Function parameters are the API key (which is 
                                 already provided), number of songs to be collected per 
                                 page, and the number of pages from the top songs list. 
                                 For testing purposes, we recommend keeping these 
                                 numbers low (otherwise, the overall entire program will 
                                 be slowed by the lyric collecting function). The raw 
                                 results of the function are saved in 
                                 "gettracks_output.csv".

                    getlyrics(): Given that "gettracks_output.csv" already exists, this 
                                 function attempts to collect the full lyrics to each of 
                                 the songs in "gettracks_output.csv" through a webscraper 
                                 using the website LyricWikia. The raw results of the 
                                 function are saved in "getlyrics_output.csv".

                    datastats(): This function produces a series of tests for or 
                                 equivalent to missing data for all variables in both 
                                 "gettracks_output.csv" and "getlyrics_output.csv". The 
                                 results of the tests are outputted into 
                                 "Data Quality.txt".

                  addfeatures(): This function adds 3 additional features to the 
                                 "gettracks_output.csv" dataset (a flag variable for 
                                 duplicate instances of the key variable 'url', a new 
                                 rank variable, and a variable of artist popularity) 
                                 and 1 additional feature to the "getlyrics_output.csv" 
                                 dataset (character count for the lyrics variable 
                                 excluding punctuation marks and white spaces). The 
                                 results of this function are 
                                 "gettracks_output_newfeatures.csv" and 
                                 "getlyrics_output_newfeatures.csv". The only difference 
                                 between these datasets and the original outputs are the 
                                 addition of the new features. These datasets were created 
                                 in order to leave the original datasets in raw form for 
                                 review purposes.

2) "Project 1 Writeup.docx"    
  
                    This is the writeup that explains the data science problem, potential 
                    analyses, collection of new data, data issues, and data cleaning.

3) "getlyrics_output.csv"

                    This is raw output from the collection of the top tracks using the 
                    Last.fm API.

4) "gettracks_output.csv"

                    This is raw output after collecting the lyrics of each song from
                    "getlyrics_output.csv" using LyricWikia. It only contains the key
                    variable "url" (for merging purposes with the track data) and the 
                    lyrics.

5) "getlyrics_output_newfeatures.csv"

                    This is the same as "gettracks_output.csv" with the exception of the 
                    inclusion of 3 new features generated by the addfeatures() function 
                    mentioned above.

6) "gettracks_output_newfeatures"

                    This is the same as "getlyrics_output.csv" with the exception of the 
                    inclusion of 1 new feature generated by the addfeatures() function 
                    mentioned above.

7) "Data Quality.txt"

                    This is output of the data quality tests performed on the variables
                    within "getlyrics_output.csv" and "gettracks_output.csv". It contains 
                    percentages for the missing (or equivalent) values and an overall 
                    rating of data quality (which is a simple average of the missing 
                    percentages from the individual variables.
