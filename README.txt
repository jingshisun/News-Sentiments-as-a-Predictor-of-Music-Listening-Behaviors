ANLY 501 Project: Sentimental Analysis of Music Listening Behaviors

This project use news sentiments as a predictor of music listening behaviors by python.

It is a collaborated project accomplished by me and Joo Chung.

This project consist of 3 parts: 

Part I:
	
	• Gathered data (> 30G) from Last.fm API, LyricWikia and EventRegistry.org, and processed data cleaning.

Part II:
	
	• Conducted sentimental analysis and clustering analysis (Ward, k-means, and dbscan) on the data set basedon six so-called “basic” emotions (e.g. happiness, surprise, and fear) to get insights of the data.
	
	• Applied Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines to predict cohesion ofsentiments between songs and news articles.

Part III:
	
	• Generated interactive visualizations to present the relationships between song popularity and sentimentsof news articles.
